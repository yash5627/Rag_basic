    "text": " In this video, I will tell you about Javascript events. Javascript has many events like you want to take the mouse inside any element or you want to take it out of there. You can click on any element, double click on it. We will see about all these events in this video. Like this video and write down in the comments section Javascript OP if you are enjoying Javascript. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. Alright guys, I am here in my computer screen. I will make video 74 here. And today we will talk about events. And why events are very important. And why you will want to use them so much. Make an index.html and put boilerplate and put script colon src. I will waste some time. And make script.js and I will tell you that we have some events which we need. I have told this very clearly in the notes. That browser event is a signal. That something happened. You can make custom events too. But there are many events which you get to see built in in Javascript. You can listen to events. And there are different events which you can see from MDN. I will start here very fast. I will make a button here. I will make a container. And I will make a box in the container. I will make a box. I will write here. And then I will write a button. And here I will write. Click me to change content. Or I will write change content. Change content. And here I will give this button an id. In the name of btn. What can I do? I can say that btn is equal to document.getElements by id. And I will say btn. Take the id of btn. And I can keep the id of any button. I can keep the id of btn. That will be my choice. And I can say button.addEventListener And the first argument of this is Which event you want to listen to. And the second argument is The function which will run once you listen to the event. If you feel this is a little overwhelming. I will explain that it is a function. First I took the element here. And I am saying that when you click on the button. Then here I have written the name of this event. Click. This event can be double clicked. This event can be mouse over. I mean I can take the mouse to that button. And after that I will say that As soon as you click on this. What you do? Change this content. I will say document. I can do anything on its click. I can put an alert. I will put an alert. I will click on this. I have written this. And as soon as I will run this. And I will click on this. And this is what I have written. This means that the listener who clicks. Is working. And is working well. All right. Now I want to show you that I can do anything I want. I can say document.getElement by class name. And I will say I will use query selector. Whenever I have to select one element. And I will say dot box. Because it has a class box. So this element will be selected. And I will say that the inner htm. Do that. This you were clicked. Enjoy your click. Okay. I have written this. So what will happen? The content of this will change. I will show you. I clicked this. Enjoy your click. I will reload. I will click on change content again. You see this. Enjoy your click. So this way we can listen to the events. If I write browser events.mdn. Then I will have the reference of events. And the reference of the event. What will I tell you? What will be the reference of the event? What are the events? There are many types of events related to mouse. If I want to see all the events. Then I will open these mouse events. Like this. And here I got this page. I will copy and paste this page. So that you can easily get all the events. Okay. And I will comment out. And I will write here. List of all mouse events. So that you can get all the mouse events. And you will get the list. I want you to click on double click. You can read all these methods. It is an event called dbl click. Okay. You can do anything. If I click double click. You can search on the internet. What kind of event is this? So that I can listen to double click. If it happens. You will know. I will do the work here. Index.html. I will do the double click. I did not do anything. I did nothing. I did double click. So that means I am listening to double click. I can listen to double click. Sometimes I want to make windows clone. So I can do double click. And then I can listen to double click. Then mouse down. That means when you press the mouse button. And then mouse leave. Fired when the pointer of a pointing device is moved out of an element. That has a list. That means mouse took the arrow. Okay. Mouse down means you pressed the button. As soon as you press it will be the same. Mouse enter mouse leave. That means you took it and removed it. Okay. What does mouse out mean? That when you off the element to which the listener is attached. Or off one of its children. Or if you will get rid of it. Okay. So all these events need to be kept. To be honest. What is the story of all these events? No. I don't want to lie. You should not be kept. While doing work, it will come. While doing trial and error, things will come. I have definitely kept some things. Like context menu. With which the right click opens. So this event will open. Means when you will do right click. So if I go to context menu. I will show you. I will make another copy of this. And I will say. When context menu opens. Then alert. And say. Right click please. Where I will write. Don't right click. Don't. Hack us by right click please. Okay. I know I did this. So I will do right click as soon as I reload it. I did right click. I don't know why it didn't work. Let me see why it didn't work. I will do right click on this. So don't hack us by right click please. Okay. So I will do right click. Don't hack us by right click please. Okay. So what will happen when you do right click. This is what you are listening to. So there are many events like this. Keyboard events. Keydown. Keyboard events. Keydown. Keypress. Okay. Fires. When that produces a character values press down. Okay. Key up. Okay. Then this is mouse events. Keyboard events. All events are enumerated on this page. So you can see it. Okay. So you can see it. Okay. So I will do right click. Key down. So what happens is that I will do right click. The second argument is event object. It is called event object. And if I lock it and show you. So you can see the event here. It is printed. I will inspect. And as soon as I press any button on keyboard. I pressed G. I pressed G. Nothing happened. So here I have to take my mouse here. Because I have put this event on this. So if I press D. I have clicked on it. And after that I will press any button. So see it is working. So I will reload. And I will click on it. And after that I will press something. So here I can see it. So what I have to do? I want to work on this event for the rest of my life. So I will put this on document. So whenever I press key. I will press H. So this is what I am showing. And this key code is showing me. So I can say that. Print E.key. Print E.key. Print E.key. And you can see that I am pressing anything. Here in the document. So this is key code. So what happens with key code? If we want to take a key as a number. We can take it. I want to make a game. And I want Mario to come here. So when I press up arrow. So I have pressed up arrow. So what is arrow up? It is key. And what is key code? Key code is 30K. Now the key code has been cut. And this property has been deprecated. Which means we don't have to use it. We have to use the key code. We don't have to use the key code. So I will check which key is which. If I press arrow up. And it becomes intuitive to see the code. So you can use key code. Keyboard events. Document events. Then there are some form events. Like when the form is submitted. When the form is focused. When the input is focused. So you can check out all these events. So if I search for form events. I hope I will get the form event. I will search for focus. Focus, focus in, focus out. Focus, focus in, focus out. Focus, focus out. So the event is focused. Like if there is an input. Then you will see this event. Now the concept I am going to teach you. That is very important. And for that I will make a whole file. And it's name is Event Bubbling. What is this event bubbling? It is asked in the interview. Listen carefully. So I will do the work. That here I will write event bubbling. And I want you to see what I am doing here. So that you can clearly see. So what I will do is here I will write div.container. Okay. I will make it. And I will write it as container1. I will do the work. Div.container. Okay. And div. Child container. Okay. After office I will write div. And I will span it. Okay. I will span it. And I will tell you why I am doing it. To explain things. I have span it. Okay. And after this I will put a div. Div.child. Okay. And I will write it as a child. And that's it. Okay. I have done this. Now you will understand this. It is a very important concept. I am saying it again and again. Script. S.R.C. Script. And what I will do here. I will say whenever someone click on child. Then what should happen? You will put an alert that child is clicked. Put something like this. Okay. So there is no big thing. I will say document. Get element by query selector. And I will say dot child. Dot Add event listener. I will copy the code. I will copy it. And I will say click on it. Dot add event listener. I am writing a single liner. I will say click on it. Then what should I do? I will write child was clicked. Child was clicked. Okay. And I will document it. So child was clicked. I wrote it here. What I will do after this? I will put one more event listener. And this time I am going to put this event listener on child container. I will say child container. I will write child container was clicked. I will do the same thing. On which container? On which container? And I will say container was clicked. Okay. Simple thing. And I will click on it. I will click on it. And I will click on it. I will not click on the context menu. I will click on it. The first argument is click. Add event listener. I will do the word wrap off. I have put an event listener. Child was clicked. Child container was clicked. Child container was clicked. Child was clicked. When I click on child. Then automatically this event will be bubble. This means JavaScript says You clicked on child. If you are living in UP Then you live automatically in India. You live automatically in Asia. And if you live in this world Then the answer is yes. JavaScript says If you click on child Then technically you clicked on child container. Because child container was clicked. And technically you clicked on container. Because container is complete. It is complete. It is complete. So technically you clicked on container. That is why event bubble up. It is called event bubbling. It means It means that The click event was on it. But it was on it. Then you clicked on the body. You clicked on HTML. I will show you. I will give some styling on this child. I will give styling. I will say that the dot child Click on it. Alice blue and I Border 2 pixels I will give padding 34 pixels I will give margin 34 pixels And if I run it I clicked child. If I click on child then child was clicked. I will show you. Child container was clicked. Okay. Container was clicked. But I clicked on child. So that you can see where child is. cursor pointer Okay. So if I click on child then child was clicked. Okay. Child container was clicked. Container was clicked. If I work outside it. I give padding everywhere. I give child container too. Child.child container Child.child container I will give background here. I will give some other. I will give it. I will give margin padding here. I will do same thing In container too. I will say that I will do it in container too. This time I will change color. I will do something else. I will give color. I will give it 1414. I gave margin padding. So 1414. And we will do 1414. Okay. Now you can see Here This is our Child container. I have put a span. I will do it. Because span is an inline element. I will section it. It will be a little easier. This is child. This is parent. So if I click here. I am child. Child container was clicked. Container was clicked. Okay. I have put these three events. By the way, if you are thinking why the body was clicked. Because three events are listed. All the confusion I am giving before your question. Okay. Now you ask me, I don't want this. I click on child container. Why is it happening? I don't want bubbling. JavaScript says we will do body pool bubbling. Technically, things are better. Look, you clicked on it. You did it on it. It is okay. But I don't want it. Please forgive me. JavaScript says you don't want it. Stop the propagation. What do you mean? Stop the propagation. I will tell you what happens. I told you that if you are using any event listener. You can take an event object. And you can play with that event. You can play with that event. So you say E.stop propagation. E.stop propagation. And what will this method do? It will stop the propagation. That means there will be no bubbling. This behavior will not be shown. So you see, when I click on this child. Only child will see it. I will comment on it. I have stopped the propagation on child. If I click on child, child was clicked. That's it. The propagation stopped. The event was not propagated. It was not like that. I have also fired on child. No. It will not be like that. It was only on child. Because I have stopped the propagation. I said handle the event on child. It is equal. I don't want the propagation from it. Okay. So this is. I am a child. It is very good. But if I click on it outside. Child container was clicked. It was not a problem. I will stop the propagation here. So this event. All the elements above. There will be no fire on it. That's why it says. Stop the event bubbling. The question is asked in interviews. What is event bubbling? If you listen to any event on any element. The listener will be activated. But his parent will also be activated. Because you are clicking on any element. So technically you are clicking on his parent. If you are dancing in room number 4. Then you are dancing in your house. You are dancing in your city. And you are dancing in your state. You are dancing in this world. You are dancing in this world. You are dancing in solar system. So technically you are. Your event has been propagated. Someone will ask. If you see an alien. He will say he is dancing on earth. He is dancing on earth. So he says. Event bubbling. If you want to say. You are dancing in this room. You don't want people to say. You are dancing in this world. You stop the propagation. I am not dancing in this house. I am dancing in this state. So this is how you stop the event propagation. I hope you understood. And I hope you enjoyed. Understanding this concept. Understanding this concept. I have written everything in notes. The way we add the event listener. We can remove the event listener. Like. Add event listener is used to assign multiple handlers to an event. Along with that. Remove event listener. You. See the same function. See the same function object. Remove event listener. You can make a variable. You can say. You can add an event listener. You can add an event listener. And if you want to remove. You can use the same variable. You can remove it. Event listener will be removed. I have already told you about the event object. Event.type. Event.current.target. Event.client.x. Client.y. In the case of your coordinate cursor. In the case of mouse event. By the way. Event.exe event. Sorry. Event.key. So you can print the event. And inspect the object yourself. So if I have to. See what happened. The event was printed. And if you want. What is in this event. You can see. What is in this event. You can see. It is all true. It is all false. If you press Alt. Then Alt is false. If you press Alt. Then it is true. If you want. You can see. Press D. You can do all these things. It is very simple and straightforward. And I have written it with more beauty. There are practice sets. Which you can solve. But I have covered everything. Now you can handle events through HTML attribute. Like you can write onclick is equal to this. And run a JavaScript function like this. Or you can do this. Element.onclick is equal to this. Function invoked. You have seen in these notes. And you have to do this. But the traditional method is this. Mostly used method is this. What will you do. You will use an element.addEventListener. You will write the name of the event. And you will put the function. Run this function. If this event is fire. Ok. Good. So here we have talked about all these things. Now one thing left. I want to tell you. SetTimeout. I want to cover that in this video. I don't want to make more videos with this. Because this is very straightforward. If I want something to happen. Ok. I will do it again and again. I will do it in this page. I want one thing to happen repeatedly. Every 2 seconds. So I can use SetInterval. SetInterval is a function. Which takes a function. Which takes a function and takes time. How long it takes. In millisecond. So if I write 3000 here. So it means. In every 3 seconds. You will get to see. Whatever is happening in this. So I will say. In every 3 seconds. Change the color of the child container. Ok. Child container. Dot style. Dot background. Is equal to up. Red color. Ok. In every 3 seconds. I want to generate a random color. Ok. So what can I do. I will do something. Like this. Because I don't want to do this again and again. In 72. I made a random color generator. Ok. So I will open with code. And this was our random color generator. I will delete this. Because I did the solution. I will copy the getRandomColor function. Ok. And I will take it in my script. Ok. Because I don't want to take too much time. I will document the format. And what I will do here. I will get random color. Ok. Simple. I will get a random color in every 3 seconds. So if I show you a page. Look at the page. It changes its color in every 3 seconds. If you want to do this. You can do this. Simply. You can do this in 3 seconds. It changes in every 1 second. Look. It changes in every 1 second. Ok. So what will the interval do. You can do this. Repeat this. Repeat this. If you want to run some set of code in every second. You can do this. Ok. Then there is a clear interval. If I say let A is equal to this. Console.logA So what will it give me. I will reload it. What will it give me. Oops. I want to inspect. I want to open the console. I will say clear interval. Clear interval. I will say 1. So what will happen. I will enter. So this interval is clear. You can use this number. You can use this number. And the set interval. That will stop. Ok. Now I will tell you the same thing. I will tell you the same thing. I will make a copy of it. I will make a copy of it. Because the syntax is exactly the same. Yes. Set timeout. Set timeout only runs once after a certain period of time. So you see here. I said 5 seconds later. Change the color after 1 second. So I will reload it. Change the color after 1 second. Just once. If I want something to work after a second. I can use set timeout. So A is equal to I have set timeout. So you see here. After setting timeout. After 1 second. The color changed. And I can clear the set timeout. I want you to know that after 5 seconds. The color changes. I will reload it. You count 5 seconds. The color will change after 5 seconds. After 5 seconds. I will reload it. And I want to know what I have done. I don't want to change the color. I will write timeout. I will keep this as a copy. Before this. If I have run clear timeout. Then it is clear. I have changed my mind. I will not change the color after 5 seconds. So after 5 seconds. This function will not run. Because I have done clear timeout. So to cancel the set interval. We use clear interval. To cancel the set timeout. We use clear timeout. This is simple. I hope you understood. We have covered a lot with red set. It is important to access the notes. Because this is what you will remember. All the things you have done in the Sigma course. Then MDN reference is also there. You are giving it in your house. For 400 rupees a month. Tell me in the comment section. I hope you understand. How important it is to download the notes. And you understand all the concepts. You are doing one thing. You have to review the course. Give me 5 stars. I am not giving you any compulsion. If you do it will be nice. The new people who are joining the course. It will be very helpful. They will know whether to do the course or not. That's all for now. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Subscribe to our channel."
